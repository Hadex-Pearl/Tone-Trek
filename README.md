# Tone-Trek
ToneTrek is a DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency) demodulation repository designed to accurately decode and interpret DTMF signals. DTMF is a signaling technique used in telecommunication systems, commonly found in touch-tone telephone keypads, interactive voice response systems, and various other applications. 

This repository investigates demodulation algorithms that accurately captures and analyzes DTMF signals in real-time.
